Use memory as you can for intermediate calculations for lower gas.


# function types
- public vs private.
- view, same as constant, which doesn't change contract's data
- pure, won't read or modify contract's data
- payable, can pay ether when calling this function

# more about functions
Functions that modify contract data should not return values.
